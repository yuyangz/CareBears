# Plants vs. Bacteria
### What It Presents
Our project offers a simulation of a garden-like environment, in which there are two organisms: plants and bacteria.  Both serve to impede the growth of the other.  There are also environmental factors that affect their growth and death; these include precipitation, temperature, sunlight, and food.  The organisms will need both a minimum and a balance of all factors to sustain their life.  This means a plant will need certain amount of water present to grow, and if there is too much water, it will start to die.

### How It Works
There are two arrays that contain plants and bacteria, respectively, as well as one that contains buttons for plant, rain, sunlight, and bacteria.  These buttons will appear at the top right side of the screen, and must be pressed to use the desired function, i.e. press the "Plant" button to plant where the mouse is clicked.  Placing a plant requires the pixel that is clicked on to have a required amount of water (from rain) to allow the plant to grow.

# Launch Instructions
Open Woo.pde file with processing.  Press the play button near the top left corner.  The first thing that pops up will be a start screen; just the press the start button near the bottom of the screen.  Once the simulation has started, press the buttons on the top right side of the screen to change the mouse's mode (i.e. press the "Plant" button to plant).  If pressing the button doesnt trigger something to happen on the screen, press the screen manually with the mouse. The user may use the keyboard as certain button shortcuts. To increase the amount of rainfall, press the "r" key on the keyboard. To see the amount of rain in areas within the environment, press the "q" key on the keyboard.
