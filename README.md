# Plants vs. Bacteria
### What It Presents
Our project offers a simulation of a garden-like environment, in which there are two organisms: plants and bacteria.  Both serve to impede the growth of the other.  There are also environmental factors that affect their growth and death; these include precipitation, temperature, sunlight, and food.  Other special factors are snowstorms, earthquakes and thunderstorms; these have yet to be implemented.
### How It Works
There are two arrays that contain plants and bacteria, respectively, as well as one that contains buttons for plant, rain, sunlight, and bacteria.  These buttons will appear at the top right side of the screen, and must be pressed to use the desired function, i.e. press the "Plant" button to plant where the mouse is clicked.
