As the basic functionalities of our classes are mostly complete, we will now 
work to combine and link the classes together so they can interact. We will 
soon implement pollen so the bacteria and plants may interact with each other 
more. We plan to have the the interactions between the environment and plants 
complete by the end of this week. This would include limiting where the plants
can be placed depending on the amount of water on each block (when pressing g
to see the grid). In addition, we will work on spacing out plants so that they 
cannot overlap with each other. If two plants are too close, they will both 
begin to shrink. Due to the fact, the user may spam the plants button, we will
add a timer in the near future to limit the amount of times the user can plant 
within a certain time frame. The same will apply for bacteria. As of now,
bacteria is still rather simply. We will work to modify bacteria so that it will
have similar functions to a real life “bug” such that it may both help and deter
the living qualities of the plant.

By Friday (June 2nd): Affect of sunlight and rain on plants.

By Saturday (June 3rd): Limit the areas in which plants can be grown and limit the 
                        amount of times a plant can be grown.

By Sunday (June 4th): Modify bacteria class so that it will have more useful 
                      functionality.
