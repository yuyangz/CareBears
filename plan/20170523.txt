Steps for Execution (BASIC PLAN):
1. Create class plants [made, but incomplete](By May 25th, 2017)
   -Variables include:
    a. Height.
    b. Health.
    c. Temperature resistance.
    d. Hunger.
    e. Heat.
        1. Will be used to affect temperature.
	
2. Create class environment (By May 25th, 2017)(By May 28th, 2017)
   -User will be able to control factors such as:
    a. Temperature
        1. Will have radii that creates a range around the plant planted.
        2. Will depend on the type of plant being planted.
    b. Food Levels
        1. Based on water levels and temperature, the plant will require more or less food.
    c. Water Levels (through rain or other methods of watering)
        1. Based on temperature and food levels, the plant will require more or less water.
        2. Rain will be generated in random positions, and will be consumed in order of plant priority in the proximity.
    d. Soil Nutrients
        1. Can be set up in the beginning or we may allow the user to change the settings through the simulation at different points.
	
3. Connect environment with plants (allow them to interact with each other) (By May 30th).
